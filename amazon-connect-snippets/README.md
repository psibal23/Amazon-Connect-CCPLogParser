# Amazon Connect Snippets

This repository is a collection of code snippets for working with different parts of Amazon Connect. The snippets are organized by language. There's an additional directory called `tools` and a collection of projects that come with associated CloudFormation templates and Contact Flows in the `projects/` directory. 

We currently have snippets in:

* Python under [python/](python/)
* Java under [java/](java/)
* DotNet (C#) under [dotnet/](dotnet/)
* Javascript under [javascript/](javascript/)
* Go under [go/](go/)
* PowerShell [powershell/](powershell/)
* Tools [tools/](tools/)

Feel free to add more languages. Please follow the requirements in each subdirectory README.

## Snippets

| Name | Description | Links |

| Holiday Check | Can be used to check for holidays in a contact flow | [Python](python/holidaycheck) |
| Sync Instance User Data | Can be used to sync basic user information from one instance to another instance | [Python](python/syncinstances) |
| Lex Default Intent Function | pass the utterance used in Lex on default intent to a contact attribute in connect | [Python](python/LexDefaultIntentUtterance) |
| Get Available Agents | Uses the [GetCurrentMetricData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetCurrentMetricData.html) API to get all available agents in a queue | [Go](go/GetQueueAvailableAgents) |
| Add Connect User | Add a new user to Amazon Connect | [PowerShell](powershell/New-ConnectUser) |

## Projects

| Name | Description | Links |
| ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| Context Routing | Uses CTR processing, Lambda, and DynamoDB to track IVR task completion and return callers to incomplete tasks | [CloudFormation](projects/ContextRouting) |
| SCV-CrossAccountSMS | Uses Lambda and cross account permissions to allow Salesforce Service Cloud Voice provisioned Amazon Connect instances to utilize SNS to send SMS messages. | [CloudFormation](projects/SCV-CrossAccountSMS) |
| CallerHistory | The caller history project utilizes AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB to record if an individual has contacted previously though a user defined identifier and records time of last contact. | [CloudFormation](projects/CallerHistory) |
| CrossRegionCrossAccount | This project shows how to call an AWS Lambda function that exists in a separate account or a separate region using AWS Lambda permissions. | [CloudFormation](projects/CrossRegionCrossAccount) |
| GetSetDataByID | This project expands on the CallerHistory project by implementing additional functionality to get, put, and update items in Amazon DynamoDB. | [CloudFormation](projects/GetSetDataByID) |
| LastAgentRouting | This project shows how to potentially implement last agent routing for customers using a voice channel.| [CloudFormation](projects/LastAgentRouting) |
| RoutingFeatureRouting | This project shows how to capture a routing feature and use that to dynamically route a caller in a contact flow.| [CloudFormation](projects/RoutingFeatureRouting) |
| LambdaAlias | This project shows how to provide access to an AWS Lambda function Alias from Amazon Connect.| [CloudFormation](projects/LambdaAlias) |
| ContextRouting | This project demonstrates how you can use contact trace record processing, Lambda, and DynamoDB to track a callers progress through an IVR task, such as making a payment, and return them to that task should they be disonnected.| [CloudFormation](projects/ContextRouting) |
| Rate Limiter | The rate limiter project utilizes AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB dynamically to add rate limiting a caller to a Amazon Connect queue based on their phone number and/or IP address.| [CloudFormation](projects/RateLimiter) |
| CCP Log Parser| A visualisation tool to visualise CCP logs to help troubleshoot client side errors | [link](tools/CCPLogParser) |
| Connectivity Test Tool | This tool checks which web browser the agent is running, the network configuration from the client side and whether the microphone has required permissions. | [link](tools/CCPConnectivityTestTools) |
